# Community types

ParaDAO initially has default options that are designed to support 2 types of DAOs

## Fanclub

Inspired by Patreon / Substack,
individuals who produces valuable contents may be supported by a community / fan base through a DAO.

In this case,
the DAO roles will only be the Star(s) (content producers) and the supporters,
where the supporters can participate in some polls / suggestion and the Star(s) will have full control over the DAO treasury.

## Collab

Inspired by meetup.com,
a group of individuals may want to contribute to say a software code base, a meetup events etc.
Some members of the DAO should be rewarded for their contributions,
and some other members may just be users of a software or participants of an event.

In this case,
the DAO will have a selection of roles of which the users in each role may be able to vote / execute subset of actions only.
It is also likely in this case that the treasury is managed by proposals and votes.

## 3. Customisable (Coming Soon)

We want to provide user with a way to design their DAOs, the permissions and governance models.
