# Contribution based Voting Power

One of the benefits of having a DAO is to distribute decision making.
In many cases, each member of the DAO has voting power depending on the
amount of governance tokens they have.

This makes sense in many cases as they have more "skin in the game".

In some cases, however,
DAO may want to have voting power reflecting the contribution done by the individual.
This contribution allows the "promotion" of individuals into different roles which maps to different
voting power.

As we move towards [decentralised identity] solutions with [verifiable credentials] that can be tied to
onchain accounts,
and projects that provide [identity aggregation services],
it becomes easier to prevent sybil attack on DAO voting that is based on contribution. I.e. someone
cannot just use many accounts to gain the same amount of voting power as someone who has contributed).
