# Support with Staking

_Coming Soon_

## Support by staking

In addition to direct donation to a DAO,
user might want to dedicate their staking rewards to a DAO instead.

For example, Alice transfer DOTs from the relay chain to a parachain and joins a DAO,
specifying that she wants to stake it.

The DAO can then stake the tokens back on the relay chain and when Alice wants her DOTs back,
the DAO unstakes and return to Alice when she provided, keeping the staking rewards.

### ParaDAO reward tokens

ParaDAO will integrate with a [ERC20] token (with snapshots) that rewards DAOs who vote on ParaDAO proposals.
These rewards will be transfered to the DAO treasuries.
