# Prediction Market for DAOs

By providing variety of voting power calculation mechanisms does not automatically increase engagement,
ensure a great voting turnout,
or cover all decisions that needs to be made by DAOs.

ParaDAO leverages prediction markets to encourage participation in different forms.

## Voting

For example in a case of a [Collab] group,
for a proposal that has binary outcome,
i.e. _"Propose to fund the next meet-up in Lisbon: Yes or No"_,
the DAO can create a prediction market and bootstrap the liquidity so that members of the DAO
can buy Outcome Asset Tokens that aligns with the votes,
this can encourage participation as members now have additional benefit to the passing of a proposal.

The earlier members, or even non-members enter the prediction market,
the more they are rewarded compare to late comers.

## Content promotion

For example in the case of a [Fanclub],
there can be prediction market created by the star / members on content,
i.e. _"The new music video released in June 2022 has been shared more times than the one released in Jan 2022 by 31st Aug, 2022"_.

In this case,
people might choose to purchase the Outcome Asset Tokens that align with which video they like more,
it may also be the case that they help share the content to promote its circulation.
